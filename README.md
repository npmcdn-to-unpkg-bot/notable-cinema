# Notable Cinema

### About the Project

**Notable Cinema** is a platform for discussing and recommending specific aspects of films, built in Node/Express with React and MongoDB. Film information is called from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)'s API.

The web app was started as a final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive class, ending in November of 2015.

Notable Cinema is hosted at [www.notablecinema.com](http://www.notablecinema.com).
